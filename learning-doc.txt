## State and Lifecycle

>State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

>The render() function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, 
>it returns the same result each time it’s invoked, and 
>it does not directly interact with the browser.
> the render is method is called anytime there is a change in state

>Typically, in React, constructors are only used for two purposes:
>Initializing local state by assigning an object to this.state.
>Binding event handler methods to an instance.

>whenever a component is rendered to the DOM for the first time, it is called mounting
>whenever the component is removed from the DOM, It is called unmounting

> Life cycles methods are
componentDidMount() {
    //this method runs after the output of the component has been renderedto the DOM
}
componentWillUnmount() {

}

######### Things to mnow about setState > A state is often called local or encapsulated
> Do not modify a state directly instead
> Use setState

>State updates maybe asynchronous
< Example// Correct
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
// Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});

// Correct
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));

>difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly
>When using React you should generally not need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. 
>Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

for preventing the componentnot to render based on a condition, use if and else. condition false, return null


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array 
returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it:

The map() method in JavaScript creates an array by calling a specific function on each element present in the parent array.
It is a non-mutating method. Generally map() method is used to iterate over an array and calling function on every element of array.
array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)

function(currentValue, index, arr): It is required parameter and it runs on each element of array. It contains three parameters which are listed below:
currentValue: It is required parameter and it holds the value of current element.
index: It is optional parameter and it holds the index of current element.
arr: It is optional parameter and it holds the array.
thisValue: It is optional parameter and used to hold the value of passed to the function.



Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed

A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys.
